## Technical problems

During the installation i found that working with terminals in windows can be very difficult. I had problems with the command
> set CLASSPATH

and

> set DERBY_INSTALL

as they didnt seem to work. I still have no idea how i fixed it because it just started working without me doing anything special. I also tried using the given scripts that was supposed to do this automatically, but they did not work either. 


## Pending issues
While I tried to do the vogella tutorial I got a problem with Entity Managers.

This problem was first encountered while using the given maven skeleton, but after i did alot of cleaning in the filestructure it startet working(The error said 'No Persistence provider for EntityManager named todos'). This image was from when I tried to do the second part of the tutorial(the one with person, family, job). I could not get this to work a second time, so i just imported it to the working java project. To make it clear, I have no idea how I got it to work the first time, and when I got the same problem again it did not work no matter what I did.

Seems like you need a very specific file structure to get it working.
