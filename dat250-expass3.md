# Technical issues

I had no technical issues during this exercise. The installation of mongoDB went smoothly and all opperations done during the different subtasks all worked first try.

### Experiment 2

---
Using this map function: (therer should be a ';' after the end '}')

![](img/mapFunction.png)

and this reduce function:

![](img/reduce_function.png)

I got this output:

![](img/Results_from_Map_Reduce.png)

Here i have mapped each orderdate to the cust_id of each customer. As of why it's useful is a matter of opinion, because all data is useful in some way. I decided to do it like this beacuse i never used this technology before and it was a good way to understand how it worked. This output could be very useful for a store to know how often a customer buys anything at the store.

# Pending issues

No pending issues as mongoDB was very friendly to use on Windows.
