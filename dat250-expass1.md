# Software-Technology-Experiment-1
The tutorial for deploying Java applications on the Heroku cloud platform includes all the commands used, so I see no need to include every command I wrote in this report. If you have questions about how I performed a task please see the [tutorial.](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java)

# Technical problems
I didnt encounter many problems during the installation of the software development environment. The only problems i got where the usual "... is not recognised as a cmdlet" right after installation of java and maven, but this was easily fixed by refreshing the environment or restarting windows. This is also closely related to [the validation of the SDE.](#validation-of-sde)
# Validation of SDE


# Heroku problems
I did not encounter any problems exept the ones I explain in [pending issues.](#pending-issues) Heroku worked as expected during the whole tutorial.
# Pending issues
